A Swift MIDI manager.

Orginal by Gene de Lisa, give him some love for doing the original world.

I just set this up as a Swift Package, with some tweeks by me Stan Rosenbaum

The major change was that it adopted a true Delegate Pattern.

To use it in your own project, adopt and implement the MIDIManagerDelegate Protocol.
